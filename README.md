(WIP) A Java implementation of Conway's Game of Life
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life

The code is a bit messy, and should use a better cell-proximity checker for each generation so that the outer 3x3 cell border is usable space.

I will be updating this in my spare time, adding new features and refactoring the code as I become more comfortable with Java.

#### Successful Execution
